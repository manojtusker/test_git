The Python ecosystem is vast and far-reaching in both scope and depth. Starting out in this crazy, open-source forest is daunting, and even with years of experience, it still requires continual effort to keep up-to-date with the best libraries and techniques.
In this report we take a look at some of the lesser-known Python libraries and tools. Python itself already includes a huge number of high-quality libraries; collectively these are called the standard library. The standard library receives a lot of attention.
Weâ€™re also going to discuss several exciting, lesser-known libraries from the third-party ecosystem. Many high-quality third-party libraries are already well-known, including Numpy and Scipy, Django, Flask, and Requests; you can easily learn more about these.
